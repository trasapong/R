# The diagnostic plots show residuals in four different ways:
# 1. Residuals vs Fitted. Used to check the linear relationship assumptions.
#    A horizontal line, without distinct patterns is an indication for a linear 
#    relationship.
# 2. Normal Q-Q. Used to examine whether the residuals are normally distributed. 
# 3. Scale-Location (or Spread-Location). Used to check the homogeneity of 
#    variance of the residuals (homoscedasticity). Horizontal line with equally 
#    spread points is a good indication of homoscedasticity. 
# 4. Residuals vs Leverage. Used to identify influential cases.

# partial f-test is used in model building can variable selection

# H0: No significant difference in SSE of full and reduced models.
#     or : models do not significantly differ.
# H1: Full model has a significantly lower SSE than the reduced model.
#     or : Full model is significantly better than the reduced model.

# test statistic is:
# F = (SSE(Reduced)-SSE(Full))/(change in # of parameters)
